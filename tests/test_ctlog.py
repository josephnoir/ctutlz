Note that this log is intended for testing purposes only and will only log
certificates that chain to a root explicitly added to it.
To add a test root to Testtube, please email google-ct-logs@googlegroups.com

A test root for Testtube should:

  * have a certificate "Subject" field that:
    * includes the word "Test" (to reduce the chances of real certificates being mixed up with test certificates.
    * identifies the organization that the test root is for (to allow easy classification of test traffic).
  * not allow real certificates to chain to it, either because:
    * it is a self-signed root CA certificate identified as a test certificate (as above).
    * it is an intermediate CA certificate that chains to a root certificate that is also identified as a test certificate.
  * be a CA certificate, by:
    * having CA:TRUE in the Basic Constraints extension.
    * include the 'Certificate Sign' bit in the Key Usage extension.

Note that for historical reasons Testtube includes some test roots that do not
comply with all of the above requirements.
